# Solow Model
	- ## Assumptions
		- K is no longer fixed
			- investment causes growth
			- depreciation causes shrinkage
		- L is no longer fixed
			- population growth
		- *Constant returns to scale*
		- Saving rate, s, is fixed
	- **output per worker** #formula
		- y = Y/L
	- **capital per worker** #formula
		- k = K/L
	- Let z = 1/L
	- Y/L = F(K/L, 1)
	- y = F(k, 1) = f(k)

	- Y = C + I
		- G = 0
	- y = c + i
	- c = (1 -s)y
